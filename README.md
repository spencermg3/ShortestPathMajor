# ShortestPathMajor
A program that will take in parameters and output the shortest valid path (course number wise) to achieve a major(s) at Macalester College. The problem of satisfying one major is often trivial enough but many students who pursue double or even triple majors may spend hours toiling over major requirements and course offerings to discover the most optimal way to achieve their degrees. This program solves that problem.
